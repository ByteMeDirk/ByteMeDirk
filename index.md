containerization, I consistently deliver solutions that drive measurable growth and unlock data-driven opportunities.

## What I Offer

- Design and implementation of scalable enterprise data platforms (cloud/on-premises)
- Data lakehouse/warehouse architectures and robust MLOps pipelines
- Technical leadership, mentoring, and process improvement
